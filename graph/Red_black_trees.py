# Red-Black Tree is a self-balancing Binary Search Tree (BST) where every node follows following rules.
# 1) Every node has a color either red or black.
# 2) Root of tree is always black.
# 3) There are no two adjacent red nodes (A red node cannot have a red parent or red child).
# 4) Every path from a node (including root) to any of its descendant NULL node has the same number of black nodes.
