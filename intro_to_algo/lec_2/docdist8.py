# docdist8.py - treat whole file as a single "line"
#
# Original version by Erik D. Demaine on January 31, 2011,
# based on code by Ronald L. Rivest (see docdist[1-7].py).
#
# Usage:
#    docdist8.py filename1 filename2
#     
# This program computes the "distance" between two text files
# as the angle between their word frequency vectors (in radians).
#
# For each input file, a word-frequency vector is computed as follows:
#    (1) the specified file is read in
#    (2) it is converted into a list of alphanumeric "words"
#        Here a "word" is a sequence of consecutive alphanumeric
#        characters.  Non-alphanumeric characters are treated as blanks.
#        Case is not significant.
#    (3) for each word, its frequency of occurrence is determined
#    (4) the word/frequency lists are sorted into order alphabetically
#
# The "distance" between two vectors is the angle between them.
# If x = (x1, x2, ..., xn) is the first vector (xi = freq of word i)
# and y = (y1, y2, ..., yn) is the second vector,
# then the angle between them is defined as:
#    d(x,y) = arccos(inner_product(x,y) / (norm(x)*norm(y)))
# where:
#    inner_product(x,y) = x1*y1 + x2*y2 + ... xn*yn
#    norm(x) = sqrt(inner_product(x,x))

import math
    # math.acos(x) is the arccosine of x.
    # math.sqrt(x) is the square root of x.
